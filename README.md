# Little web game project using ReactJS

This is a school project that i made for a first use of React.

This project consists on a button game it has some functionalities like: 

  - useState
  - Reset Button
  - DMG Counter
  - A game over detector which will disable the buttons when the hp of the player or the Bot is 0
  - A translatable image when ultimate skill used (you have to use a certain amount of "normal" skills to use the ultimate).
